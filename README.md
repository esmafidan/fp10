## Apple Vision Pro Feedback Sentiment Analysis

### Project Overview
This project involves analyzing customer feedback for the Apple Vision Pro using sentiment analysis techniques. The goal is to extract insights into customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction by categorizing feedback into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments and identifying specific aspects of the product that customers like or dislike.

The analysis is performed using Python libraries such as TextBlob for sentiment analysis and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

### Features
1.) Data Extraction:

Connects to a SQLite database to fetch feedback data.
Exports data to an Excel file for further analysis.

2.) Sentiment Analysis:

Analyzes feedback text using the TextBlob library.
Assigns a sentiment score and categorizes it into Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

3.) Visualization:

Generates bar charts, box plots, and pie charts to illustrate sentiment distribution.
Saves all visualizations to a multi-page PDF file.

4.) Insights and Recommendations:

Summarizes feedback data to identify areas of improvement and highlight strengths of the product.

### Files Included
1.) feedback.db: 

The SQLite database containing customer feedback.

2.) feedback.xlsx: 

Exported Excel file with feedback data from the database.

3.) feedbackresults.xlsx: 

Excel file containing sentiment analysis results.

4.) Visualizations.pdf: 

PDF file with visualizations of sentiment analysis results.

5.) README.md: 

Documentation for the project.

### Prerequisites
Install the following Python libraries before running the project:

pandas
sqlite3 (standard library)
textblob
matplotlib
seaborn
openpyxl
You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas textblob matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
Instructions
1. Set Up
Place the feedback.db database file in the appropriate directory.
Update the file paths in the script to match your local system.
2. Run the Script
Execute the Python script to:
Extract feedback from the database.
Perform sentiment analysis on the feedback comments.
Generate visualizations and save them to a PDF.
Example:

bash
Copy code
python sentiment_analysis.py
3. Output
The sentiment analysis results will be saved to feedbackresults.xlsx.
Visualizations will be saved to Visualizations.pdf.
Visualization Examples
1. Bar Chart:
Displays the distribution of sentiment categories (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
2. Box Plot:
Shows sentiment score distributions by category.
3. Pie Chart:
Illustrates sentiment distribution percentages.
Future Improvements
Use an advanced NLP library (e.g., OpenAI GPT or spaCy) for more nuanced aspect extraction.
Automate recommendations based on the analysis results.
Incorporate feedback from additional datasets for a comprehensive analysis.
